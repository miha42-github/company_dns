4 Digit SIC codes with descriptions in CSV 
=========

http://data.gov doesn't have a simple list of all the 4 digit SIC codes and their descriptions. It should be easier than this.

This is a downloadable list of the 4 Digit SIC codes in CSV format

How the data was created:

1. copy, pasted, and pythoned from http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.html
1. save file as CSV format using open office
